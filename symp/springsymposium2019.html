	    Sellers Mansion, Baltimore</strong>, presented by <em>Adam Fracchia</em></h4>
            
            <p align="left" style="color:black">In the summer and fall of 2018, salvage excavations were conducted in advance of 
	    proposed renovations to the three-story Sellers Mansion at 801 North Arlington Avenue in West Baltimore. Excavations in 
	    the yard area documented architectural features and material culture associated with the occupation of the house starting 
	    in late 1860s and confirm the eccentric narrative linked to the history of the property and its owners. Archeological 
	    testing also uncovered evidence of an earlier occupation of the site as well as more current and clandestine uses of this 
	    vacant lot. Taken together, the archeological record presents a unique picture of the evolution of a neighborhood in West 
	    Baltimore and the City of Baltimore.</p>
            
            <p align="left" style="color:black">9:50 AM: <strong>Using Low-Visibility Underwater Archeology in an Effort to Account for 
	    our Missing</strong>, presented by <em>Carolin McManus</em></p>
            
            <p align="left" style="color:black">The Institute of Maritime History (IMH) maps and reports submerged anomalies in Maryland 
	    waters and beyond. IMH’s previous work on submerged aircraft drew the attention of the Department of Defense POW/MIA 
	    Accounting Agency (DPAA), whose mission is “to provide the fullest possible accounting for our missing personnel to their 
	    families and the nation.” At DPAA’s request and under the direction of archeologist Stefan Claesson, a team of IMH divers 
	    traveled to Germany in November 2018 to conduct reconnaissance on a submerged B-17 bomber and provide any data available to 
	    assist in locating two MIA airmen shot down in 1945. This presentation will recount the preparation for this mission, the 
	    remarkable cultural interaction experienced and what was accomplished through complementary skills and teamwork.</p>
            
            <p align="left" style="color:black">10:40 AM: <strong>A Brief History of Prehistoric Archeology in the Middle Atlantic 
	    Region</strong>, presented by <em>Dennis Curry</em></p>
            
            <p align="left" style="color:black">Prehistoric archeology in the Middle Atlantic region has now entered its second century 
	    of study. This presentation will look at this history from a historical perspective. Some of the subjects considered include 
	    the influence of individual personalities and institutions, the changing motivations for undertaking archeological 
	    investigations, and trends in the foci of archeological research. Particular attention is paid to the role of the Middle 
	    Atlantic Archeological Conference over the course of its almost 50 years. The very concept of a “Middle Atlantic culture 
	    area” is considered. And lastly, some thoughts on the future of Middle Atlantic archeology are offered.</p>

            <p align="left" style="color:black"><strong>The Richard E. Stearns Memorial Lecture is named in honor of Richard E. 
            Stearns (1902-1969), curator of the Department of Archeology at the Natural History Society of Maryland for more than 30 
            years. Mr. Stearns located numerous archeological sites in the Chesapeake area, and carefully documented his surface and 
            excavated finds. He published numerous archeological articles and several monographs, and donated his collection to the 
            Smithsonian Institution. A commercial artist by profession, he was nonetheless a pioneer in Maryland archeology, 
            instrumental in recording much of Maryland prehistory.</strong></p>
           
            <p align="left" style="color:black">11:15 AM: <strong>Making a Future for the Past</strong>, presented by <em>Bernard Means</em></p>
           
            <p align="left" style="color:black">While the public might associate archeology with the use of shovels and a certain 
	    whip-carrying, fedora-wearing adventurer, archeologists are increasingly reliant on technological tools and approaches drawn 
	    from the hard sciences. Some tools are tried and true, such as radiocarbon dating, while others are newer but used in more 
	    frequency, such as 3-D scanning and drone mapping. This presentation will examine the history of these tools and also explore 
	    ways that K-12 schools and the general public can interact with the past via 3-D printing.</p>

            <p align="left" style="color:black">1:00 PM: <strong>Ceramics, Lithics, Oysters and Beads: Investigating Political Complexity 
	    in the Rappahannock Indigenous Borderland</strong>, presented by <em>Matt Borden</em></p>
           
            <p align="left" style="color:black">This paper attempts to trace the development of political complexity among Native 
	    communities in the Rappahannock River valley. Scholars including Martin Gallivan have created a compelling model of social 
	    and political development of Native groups along the James River, while less prominent regions such as the Rappahannock 
	    River have remained understudied. The Rappahannock Indigenous Borderlands Project addresses this imbalance and provides new 
	    data for analysis about these less studied native groups. This paper analyzes data generated by this ongoing project to gain 
	    insight into the local groups’ political and social structure. To that end, population, resource control, and exchange are 
	    examined through an analysis of the distributions of ceramics, prestige goods, oysters and exotic lithics, both within and 
	    among sites.</p>

            <p align="left" style="color:black">1:45 PM: <strong>The Middle Atlantic Culture Area Concept</strong>, presented by 
	    <em>Heather A. Wholey</em></p>
          
            <p align="left" style="color:black">The Middle Atlantic is a relatively spatially compressed, yet highly diverse region 
	    whose archeology has defied simple definition and has been challenging to distinguish as a research unit. Unlike other 
	    North American culture areas, it is characterized by a great deal of heterogeneity. Due to the ecological and cultural 
	    mosaic that depicts the Middle Atlantic region, archeologists tend to focus their work within specific river drainages, 
	    within a certain physiographic province, on a particular culture group or around a specialized research problem. It can 
	    thus be challenging to see the unity in Middle Atlantic archeology or to see the Middle Atlantic as a cohesive culture 
	    area. This talk will cover some of the historical background on the development of the Middle Atlantic culture area concept 
	    and discuss arguments surrounding the Middle Atlantic region as a research entity.</p>

            <p align="left" style="color:black"><strong>Iris McGillivray was a founding member of the Archeological Society of Maryland, 
            Inc., ably serving the Society for over 30 years as secretary, president, newsletter editor, field session registrar and 
            membership secretary. She is perhaps best known and respected for her organization of the annual Spring Symposium, first 
            held in 1965, arranging all aspects of the day-long program. In 1991 Iris was presented with the Society's William B. Marye 
            Award to honor her services to archeology in Maryland.</strong></p>
           
            <p align="left" style="color:black">2:30 PM: <strong>Cultural Complexity in the Middle Atlantic: A Case for The Abbott Farm 
	    National Historic Landmark</strong> , presented by <em>Gregory D. Lattanzi, Ph.D.</em></p>
          
            <p align="left" style="color:black">No other archeological site in the Middle Atlantic region, or possibly the Northeast, 
	    has had more ink spilled about it than the Abbott Farm National Historic Landmark. Beginning in the mid-19th Century with 
	    Charles Conrad Abbott, countless scholars, students and of course cultural resource management archeologists have excavated, 
	    studied and written about this site. In the mid-20th Century, this site along with a handful of buried and stratified site 
	    complexes were used as a basis for reconstructing prehistoric lifeways and establishing cultural historical chronologies in 
	    the region. Archeologists have used this site to explain and mark the Middle Atlantic as having exhibited cultural 
	    complexity. This presentation will, like others before it, lay out the argument for there being a certain level of cultural 
	    complexity in this region. However, based on the many additional years of excavation and analysis, this argument can now 
	    stand on a firm and solid foundation.</p>
