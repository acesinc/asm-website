      <p>In  the 1970s, archaeologists began to question the appearance of strange symbols  and curious caches of objects on sites occupied by enslaved Africans. The  Garrison Plantation (18th -mid-19th century), near  Baltimore, was one of the first sites in Maryland where indigenous magic was  recognized by archaeologists. Here, spoons decorated with herringbone lines and  geometric shapes were found within the slave quarter.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Soon  after, University of Maryland students began to find collections of glass, buttons,  and bones secreted under the floors of the homes of elite Annapolitans. &nbsp;They even found a clay mass containing a stone  axe with straight pins, lead shot, and bent nails, four feet under a street. The  association with the metal and stone axe brought some to believe it may be  associated with Yoruba and the Fon people of Benin, who considered the axe  blade a symbol of Shango, their god of thunder and lightning. </p>
      <p>Archaeologists  have interpreted these odd scratches and collections of otherwise prosaic items  in curious contexts as African spirit practices.&nbsp; Sometimes called hoodoo, folk magic, or root  work, this belief system was brought from Africa and carried out in secret. In  creative attempts to hide this knowledge and preserve their beliefs, African  Americans began to incorporate Christian images into their practice. The incorporation  of such symbols and saints within their practice is not assimilation or creolizing  of an African religion. Instead, the use of these familiar symbols allowed West  African spirit practices to be displayed in public and without consequence. </p>

      <p>At  the Jackson Homestead (1840-1920) in Montgomery County, we found objects and  caches tucked in and under the home.&nbsp; At  least three methods to protect the Jacksons&rsquo; home were interpreted from the  artifact assemblage and its tight context, including a Catholic Infant of  Prague medallion.&nbsp; Prehistoric artifacts  were found in an interesting arrangement surrounding the foundation. Eight  quartzite projectile points were placed around the foundation. In another  instance, a stone axe was tucked in the southwest corner of the original slave  cabin. Like the find under an Annapolis street, the stone axe may be another  connection to Shango</p>

          <td><p>The  recognition of these spirit practices in archaeological sites is exciting since  it provides a template and an awareness to help us recognize Africa in  Maryland. Just as important is the ability to know when this cultural  expression is not present.&nbsp;  Archaeologists working on the Belvoir Slave Quarter (1780s-1870) in Anne  Arundel County, for example, did not find evidence of African spirit practices.&nbsp; It is possible this home&rsquo;s nearness to the manor  house dissuaded the enslaved community to practice at the quarter; or they simply  may not have adhered to these African beliefs. </p></td>
