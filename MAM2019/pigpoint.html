      <p>The Pig Point site (18AN50) in Anne Arundel County is one of  the most important pre-contact Native American sites ever investigated in  Maryland. Archaeologists excavated the site from 2009-2014 under the leadership  of Dr. Al Luckenbach and discovered a large base camp on a bluff overlooking  the Patuxent River where people lived for at least 10,000 years. The &ldquo;Lost  Towns Project&rdquo; team of professionals, volunteers, and students found over half  a million artifacts and hundreds of features at the site, many of which had  ritualistic meaning.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

          <td>The archaeologists found three separate activity areas at  Pig Point. A feasting area was situated near the edge of the bluff, where  people gathered around large fires for thousands of years. Feasts had spiritual  significance in many tribal ceremonies. Nearby, stains in the soil marked where  structures made of saplings were built in the same place for centuries. Some of  these buildings were unheated and might have been used for religious purposes,  although they could have also housed people who lived here during warm weather.  And near the top of the bluff, archaeologists were amazed to find five large,  circular burial pits that contained human remains, copper beads, and deliberately  broken stone blades. The &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; stone objects were from the Ohio River Valley  and the mound-building Adena people, demonstrating a trading network that  spanned the Appalachian Mountains over 2,000 years ago. </td>

      <p>Mandy  Melton studied the Pig Point gorgets in 2013 and found that many were marked in  mysterious ways . Some had scars from repeated  bashing with a hard, small object, while others were sanded down to remove the  polished finish, Two or three gorget fragments had helix-shaped cuts  and one even appeared to have a scratching of a bird under  dozens of crisscrossed lines . Bird motifs, like ravens or  thunderbirds, are common symbols of Native American mythology. Perhaps most  intriguing of all, two fragments with very different marks mended together.  This suggests someone broke a gorget in half and then two different people altered  their fragment in distinct ways </p>

      <p>The exact meaning behind the broken, modified gorgets has been  lost to time. But they, along with the feasting and burials, clearly suggest  that Pig Point held important ritual significance for Native Americans. Even  though the gorgets were discovered nearly 100 feet away from the burial pits,  Melon and Luckenbach  pointed out that, &ldquo;North American  groups practiced a diversity of symbolic ritual/ceremonial performances that  may or may not have included the presence of the physical body of the  deceased.&rdquo; This suggests that Native Americans may have considered the entire  Pig Point bluff to possess magical significance unlike anything seen elsewhere  in Maryland. </p>
