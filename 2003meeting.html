		<p style="color:black">Ed Chaney opened the meeting with a welcome and covered the schedule for the day. Julia King presented opening remarks in which she outlined the changing face of Maryland archeology and described the ways that the participants in this effort are working to leave a legacy that will be appreciated by our descendants. The setting of the Maryland Archeological Conservation lab was highlighted as showing the significance of what we do in the field.</p><hr>
		<p style="color:black"><strong>Business Meeting</strong> - The business meeting started
          with the usual reports from the membership secretary and our treasurer.
          Our president, Carol
          Ebright, offered the annual President's report, covering the myriad
          activities that the ASM has been involved with over the past twelve
          months. Among the activities briefed were the Spring Symposium, Annual
          Workshop in Archeology, the Tyler Bastian Field Session in Maryland
          Archeology, work with various outside organizations and promotion of
          archeology among the public of Maryland.</p><hr>

          back at the accomplishments of the past two field sessions that we
          have held at the Winslow Site. Despite the extremely harsh conditions
          this year, many unique discoveries have come from our efforts. They
          include finding what is probably the first documented evidence of structural
          features in the middle Potomac area. The discovery of at least two
          dwelling structures, along with a palisade, a dog burial and other
          features has made our work at this site a success. Of particular note
          was the discovery of a human internment in the last days of the session.
          This finding should serve to illustrate the profoundly human face of
          the sites we work on. </p><hr>

            a comprehensive picture of work that he has been involved with at
            Fox Gap in the Western Maryland hills. The survey has turned up prehistoric
            and historic settlement data as well as providing groundwork for
            a comprehensive land management plan for the area. Included in the
            relatively small footprint of the area are signs of prehistoric use
            as well as a 19th century farmstead and a civil war battlefield.
            This project involved volunteers from the Potomac Appalachian Trail
            Club in their first foray into archeology. </p><hr>

            of the day was certainly the tour given by staff at the MAC Lab.
            We were given an opportunity to peer into the workings of many parts
            of the lab, including the artifact analysis and computer cataloging
             projects center, the  artifact study
           collections, the current projects going on in the conservation lab
            and an overview of federal curation projects that are taking place.</p><hr>

          on display. In addition
          to showing us the various types of artifacts that are housed in the
          collection, she demonstrated how the latest computer software can permit
          the researcher to do detailed studies of the provenience that the artifacts

          some of the most significant
          collections in Maryland as well as to see the facility that houses
          a large number of artifacts from across the state. The study collections
          allow the researcher to see actual examples of various types of artifacts,
          making identification and cataloging a much easier task.</p><hr>

          agencies to curate and store artifact collections from federal facilities
          ranging from large sites such as Aberdeen Proving Grounds to small
          collections obtained from the Food and Drug Administration. He covered

          <p style="color:black"><strong>Howard Wellman</strong> guided us through the curation lab.
          He described the processes for preserving artifacts that often are
          subject to rapid
          degradation when they are removed from their natural resting spots.
          Tanks of polyethylene glycol were shown containing artifacts that
          must be processed over long periods of time ranging from months to
          years. He also described the process of freeze drying artifacts to
          aid in their preservation. The bulk freeze dryer is an incredible bit
          of machinery in itself. This part of the lab is most impressive and
          is an obvious showcase for the capabilities of the lab as a whole.</p><hr>

            MAC Lab, discussed the application of X-Ray analysis to archeological
            collections. He discussed traditional uses of X-Ray technology, such
            as identification of hidden features or for conducting non-invasive
            inspection of artifacts, as well as newer uses. Those include maintenance
            of large collections of metal objects. Any metal objects in a collection
            can be X-Rayed and then those prints can be used to identify objects
            for further curation. The films produced can also become part of
            the site documentation and are files with the collection itself.</p><hr>

          from an archeological survey on a property known as West' Field in
          St. Mary's City. The site, soon to become a parking lot, is the location
          where Phillip West built a structure referenced in a 1639 land survey.
          In addition to possible locations for the house, several other sites
          were discovered, including an Early Woodlands site. The survey will

            and opportunities encountered in developing an interpretive landscape
            at the St. Mary's City National Historic Landmark. Thirty years of
            investigation has provided a vivid picture of life in the 17th century
            city. this has, in turn, aided in developing the framework for a
            public interpretive exhibit that covers many aspects of early colonial
            life here in Maryland. He also present some of the newest features
            in the exhibit, including a new audio tour program which will provide
            yet another layer of interpretation for visitors to the site.</p><hr>

            The Louis Berger Group, Inc. This site, on the Patuxent River in
            Charles County dates to 1740 to 1770. It was a a small domestic quarter
            on a large plantation. The excavations revealed a large number of
            trash pits filled with animal bones and other household refuse. Analysis
            of the site is ambiguous and it is unknown whether the site was
            occupied by slaves, an overseer, tenant or some other combination.
            The results of this excavation, as well as others nearby, suggest
            that there may be no clear markers that distinguish slave occupations
            from tenants or owners.</p><hr>
