      <p>&ldquo;Magic&rdquo; in anthropological  terms, is anything people do to try to influence the supernatural. That  includes personified supernatural forces like gods, ghosts, and ancestral  spirits, and impersonal supernatural forces like luck. Usually when people try  to influence the supernatural there is a clear end in mind and a ritualized  procedure to follow. When you pick a penny up and say, &ldquo;find a penny, pick it  up, and all day long you&rsquo;ll have good luck,&rdquo; an anthropologist would classify  that as a magic ritual.</p>
      <p> There is a joke in archeology (a sub-discipline of  anthropology) that any artifact of unknown purpose must be &ldquo;ritual,&rdquo; which is  really code for &ldquo;I have no other explanation.&rdquo; That joke was born out of  legitimate criticism, but it has scared some people away from considering  ritual and magic in archeology. The burden of proof that something is &ldquo;magic&rdquo;  is very high. However, it is a disservice to our understanding of past belief  systems if we fail to consider possible ritual and magic uses of artifacts,  especially if the context calls for it. </p>
      <p>A perfect example is this horseshoe  from the Smith&rsquo;s St. Leonard plantation, which was occupied ca. 1711-1754. The  default interpretation of a horseshoe is that it was used to shoe a horse, but  historical records indicate that it was rare to shoe horses in Maryland prior  to the 1750s because the soft clay soils did not require it. Over 200 units  have been excavated at the site, resulting in over 450 boxes of artifacts from  the main house, a kitchen, a laundry, at least three slave quarter buildings, a  store house, and a stable. Only one horseshoe was found, and it was not near  the stable, but in a kitchen cellar that was filled with debris from a  remodeling episode. Horseshoes have a long history as objects placed on  thresholds, near hearths, or in ritual concealments to ward off evil or bring  good luck. Thus, history and context suggest that this horseshoe was a magical  object. </p>
      <p>It is not always possible to determine whether an everyday object was  put to a magical purpose, and that is where the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Magic and  Mystery&rdquo; theme comes in. There are many finds that might be evidence of magic,  but there is no way to know with certainty. It is still worthwhile to consider  the possibility though because it calls for an understanding of how the people  who used these artifacts viewed the world. The following essays offer more  examples of artifacts that offer insight into Maryland&rsquo;s &ldquo;magical&rdquo; past.</p>
