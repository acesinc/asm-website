      <p>Beginning in early 2018 Applied Archaeology and  History Associates, Inc. (AAHA) has been fully immersed in the restoration of  Cloverfields, one of Maryland&rsquo;s oldest standing structures, and home to the prominent  18th-century Hemsley Family for nearly two-hundred years. Located on  the eastern shore, in Queen Anne&rsquo;s County, Cloverfields dates to c.1705 and is owned  by the Cloverfields Preservation Foundation (CPF). In 2017, CPF assembled a  team of highly qualified professionals to meticulously and conscientiously  restore the house and grounds to their c.1784 appearance. Team members include Lynbrook  of Annapolis (Restoration and Project Management); Willie Graham (Head Architectural  Historian); Devin Kimmel of Kimmel Studio Architects (Lead Architect and  Landscape Architect); Sherri Marsh-Johns of Retrospect Architectural Research,  LLC (Project Research Historian); and AAHA (Archaeological Consultant).</p>
      <p>In the spring of 2018, while documenting the  original configuration of the entrance to the Cloverfields&rsquo; cellar, AAHA staff made  a unique archaeological discovery. Buried in a shallow pit, immediately beneath  the bottom cellar stair-tread was a large river cobble capping the intentional  concealment of two men&rsquo;s leather shoes. The same feature contains what appears  to be the intentional placement of a single iron horseshoe. An analysis of the shoes  determined that they were not a matching pair. Al Saguto, formerly of Colonial  Williamsburg, dated the shoes to post 1820-30 based on the form and the wooden  pegged soles.&nbsp; The shoes and horseshoe  may have been concealed during a major remodeling episode in the1840s. </p>
      <p><img src="shoes1.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br />
        While 1841Tax records indicate that Cloverfields was  possibly occupied by a tenant at that time, it&rsquo;s also possible that one of the  nine enslaved individuals listed in Levy Tax records as occupying the  Cloverfields property, could have placed the shoes beneath the stairs. But why  conceal a mismatching pair of shoes underneath the cellar stairs?</p>
      <p>The intentional concealment of shoes within  architectural spaces is not an anomaly. Thousands of shoes have been found  hidden throughout houses in England. They have been concealed in fireplaces,  stuffed in rafters, and buried under floors. The well-documented practice of shoe  concealment in fairly inaccessible locations of houses suggests intentional  placement rather than incidental loss. It is easy to misplace a pair of shoes  under the couch, but nobody ever lost a pair of shoes in the rafters of a  house; or, mistakenly bricked them up behind a fireplace; or,  inadvertently put them underneath a large rock, in the cellar, under the  stairs. </p>
      <p>At least a dozen instances of concealed shoes have  been recorded in Maryland. Documented examples include a single woman&rsquo;s  calfskin boot dating from c.1835-1860s in the cornice of the Hammond-Harwood  House in Annapolis; 22 men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s shoes and shoe soles hidden in the  attic of the c.1861-1869 Enlisted Men&rsquo;s Barracks at Fort Washington; and a pile  of boots along with a carved, two-headed figurine in the attic of the Captain&rsquo;s  House at Wye House Plantation on the Eastern Shore. &nbsp;But the question remains, why conceal shoes in  relatively inaccessible parts of houses? </p>
      <p>In England the concealment of shoes within  architectural spaces is interpreted as a means of warding off bad luck; of  capturing malicious spirits; or, in some instances, as a house offering to  bring good luck. This well-documented practice dates from the l5th to  the early 20th century. The underlying premise of using concealed  shoes as a means of personal or household protection lies both in the shoe&rsquo;s  shape as well as the personal qualities imbued in a shoe by the wearer. In  essence, shoes take on the literal shape of the wearer and therefore can act as  a form of proxy for the wearer. If a malicious entity is presumed to be  haunting you, the concealment of the shoe in a relatively inaccessible space,  such as the cellar or the attic, may draw the malicious entity to the shoe  instead. And, if luck holds, the malicious entity may become trapped in the  shoe. </p>

      <p>One particularly relevant account comes from  Chestertown, approximately 25 miles north of Cloverfields, in 1896. &nbsp;According to the informant, the burial of old  shoes, in particular the soles of old shoes, was done on a Monday to keep the  Devil down through the rest of the week. </p>
      <p>Similar practices were also documented by folklorists  throughout the American south at the turn of the 20th century. One  particularly relevant account comes from Chestertown, approximately 25 miles  north of Cloverfields, in 1896. &nbsp;According  to the informant, the burial of old shoes, in particular the soles of old shoes,  was done on a Monday to keep the Devil down through the rest of the week.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that the intentionally buried shoes in  the Cloverfields cellar brought good luck to the person who buried them in the  1840s. It has certainly brought good luck more than 150 years after the fact. The  archaeology at Cloverfields has been the most exciting project the staff at  AAHA have ever, or probably will ever, be involved with.&nbsp; The archaeological documentation of more than  300 years of life at this property has produced more than 60,000 artifacts and  ecofacts from well documented intact contexts and it is expected that  researchers will be combing through them for decades to come.&nbsp; </p>
