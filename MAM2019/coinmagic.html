      <h2>Coin Magic</h2>
      <p align="left">The use of coins for luck or protection from evil dates back thousands of years. For example, ancient Greeks placed coins in strategic locations on ships for good luck and protection. When the English arrived in Maryland in the 17th century, their belief in the magical properties of coins came with them.  </p>

          <td><p>   As early as the 1300s, the English had a custom of bending a coin&mdash; usually in thirds folded over the center&mdash; as a vow to a saint in times of crisis. The coin bender was then obliged to carry the coin on a pilgrimage and leave it at a shrine to the saint. That may be how a 1596 silver sixpence with two worn fold lines came to be at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station&rsquo;s Webster Field Annex (Figure 1). It was surface collected at a ca. 1637-1750 Jesuit plantation site that may have been the best pilgrimage destination a Maryland colonist could find after anti-Catholic legislation closed the chapel at St. Mary&rsquo;s City in 1704. </p>
            <p>Silver  coins, especially those with crosses on them, have also been used as amulets  that protected dairies against the effects of witchcraft. Witches were often  blamed when dairy cows failed to produce milk or cream would not churn into  butter, so people buried silver coins in the corners of dairies for protection  or kept a silver sixpence on hand to place in or under the churn as needed.  Silver coins were also recommended for use as ammunition to shoot at hares  suspected of being witches in disguise.<br />

    At the 2018 Archeological Society of Maryland  field session at the Calverton site (18CV22), a silver James I shilling (minted  1603-1604) was found on the edge of a posthole for the probable doorway of a 17th-century  post-in-ground structure. Similarly, half of a French silver five  sols coin, minted from 1702-1704 and exhibiting two worn fold lines,   was found deep in a post feature at the entrance to  a storehouse cellar at the ca. 1711-1754 Smith&rsquo;s St. Leonard plantation  (18CV91). The placement of these coins at entryways points to their use as  protective amulets designed to keep witches or other evil forces out.</div>

    <p>Smith&rsquo;s St. Leonard also yielded a pierced  silver two pence coin dating to the English Commonwealth (1649-1660).  This coin was recovered in the plowzone over the chimney hearth; an area often  seen as vulnerable to invasion by evil forces like witches. A cellar by that  same hearth yielded the only horseshoe found at the site, another object often  used for protection and luck.</p>

        <td><p>While  fear of witches decreased during the 18th-century Enlightenment, the  use of coins as lucky or protective charms continued. For example, sixpences  were once included in the prescribed formula for good luck in weddings,  &ldquo;Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, and a silver  sixpence in her shoe.&rdquo; </p>
          <p>Coin  bending seems to have declined when thin hammered coins gave way to thicker  milled coins, but coin alteration by piercing increased. Pierced coin charms  are found on sites dating into the 19th and 20th  centuries. Today people tend to relegate the idea of lucky coins to implausible  superstition, but anyone who has picked up a &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; penny can testify that  coin magic is still part of our culture.</p>
