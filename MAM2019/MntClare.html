      <h2>A Crystal in the Kitchen</h2>
      <p><img src="Mount Clare photo.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></p>
      <p align="left">In southwestern  Baltimore City, Carroll Park encompasses the surviving acreage of Mount Clare,  the showpiece estate of Charles Carroll the Barrister. The site is designated  as a National Historic Landmark for its excellent Federal style architecture.  Like all American plantations, Mount Clare was a predominantly black landscape,  with African and African American people far outnumbering Caucasians. The  historical record offers very little information about this majority of people  who built the federal-style mansion, worked the Carroll farmland, brickyards  and ironworks, and fed and clothed the Carroll family. </p>
      <p align="left">Over 30 years of  excavations at Mount Clare uncovered a rich archaeological record.  Investigations found the remains of the greenhouse (which inspired George  Washington&rsquo;s greenhouses at Mount Vernon), orchards, formal and kitchen  gardens, and former additions to the main house that include an office and a  kitchen. Investigations have not yet found the slave quarters. In 1986, while  excavating the circa 1767 kitchen, archaeologists recovered a 4-inch-long,  heavily worked, colorless crystal. This was later identified by archaeologist  George Logan as an intentionally buried object, likely by a person from Africa  or the diaspora. Based on its archaeological context, Logan believed that it  was intentionally buried underneath the doorway of the kitchen. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="crystals.jpg" width="600" height="526" /></p>
      <p align="left">There are several  cultural and spiritual traditions in West Africa and the Caribbean in which  objects that are believed to be imbued with ancestral spiritual power are  buried under thresholds or by hearths, either to activate the object&rsquo;s power or  to protect it from being found. As Dr. Teresa Moyer explores in her book&nbsp;<em>Ancestors  of Worthy Life: Plantation Slavery and Black Heritage at Mount Clare</em>, this  discovery is very unusual. Crystals are uncommon in buried caches, particularly  one as large as the one found at Mount Clare. Also unusual is the fact that  this crystal was found in the kitchen of the mansion, where black and white  people coexisted. Moyer posits that perhaps a cook buried the crystal as an act  of protection against Margaret Carroll and the hired servants. If these  interpretations are correct, this crystal is an example of the continuity of  cultural and religious traditions in spite of forced assimilation, and  represents the exertion of personal agency by a person who was allowed none.  &nbsp;</p>
