        Field and Laboratory Volunteer Opportunities Statewide<br />
        One of the Archeological Society of Maryland&rsquo;s main goals is to involve 
        the public in field and lab events throughout the year and across the State. To 
        meet this goal, ASM hosts a Spring Symposium and an annual Fall meeting, and  
        co-hosts with the Maryland Historical Trust a Spring Workshop and a late spring field/excavation session. ASM&rsquo;s local chapters also conduct meetings and 
        provide opportunities for members and the general public to participate in field 
        and laboratory activities. Visit our website at www.marylandarcheology.org to 
        learn about upcoming events, view the latest edition of our monthly newsletter<br />
        (ASM Ink), and link to our chapters&rsquo; websites.</p>
      <p>Baltimore Archaeology Forum<br />
Join the <strong>Baltimore  Archaeology Forum (BAF)</strong> as we work  to further the preservation, use, and awareness of the rich archaeological  heritage of the Baltimore area, including Baltimore County, Baltimore City, and  Howard County. The BAF promotes and participates in public archaeology  digs in the Baltimore area.&nbsp; Recent  salvage excavations in West Baltimore demonstrated that dedicated volunteers  can fill the gaps by exploring and protecting the archaeological resources that  are threatened on small renewal projects.&nbsp;  Archeological Society of Maryland members and interested volunteers are  welcome to join and help the BAF in exploring Baltimore&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; For more information, contact Adam Fracchia  at [<a href="mailto:fracchia@umd.edu" target="_blank">fracchia@umd.edu</a>]&nbsp;or Stephen Israel at  [stephenisrael2701@comcast.net].<br />

          <strong>Historic St. Mary&rsquo;s City: A Museum of History and Archaeology</strong><br />
Historic St. Mary's City (HSMC) is the site of the fourth permanent 
      English settlement in North America, Maryland's first capital, and the birthplace 
      of religious toleration in America. The Department of Research &amp; Collections at 
      HSMC, with St. Mary's College of Maryland, offers a Field School in Historical 
      Archaeology from May 28 through August 3, 2019. While in the field, staff and 
      students offer tours of the excavations to visitors. During the Tidewater 
      Archaeology Weekend event (July 20 &ndash; 21), members of the public can sift for 
      artifacts with the archeology team and take special tours of the archeological 
      laboratory and other museum sites. Visitors are also encouraged to explore the 
      St. John&rsquo;s Site Museum, which provides insights into ways researchers use 
      historical and archeological evidence. Contact HSMC 240-895-4990, 800-SMC-
