      <p>It is helpful to find iron objects on historic  sites. The distribution of corroded nails in the soil might indicate the  presence and layout of buildings. Common objects made of iron&mdash;such as stoves,  cookware, and tools&mdash;can reveal where past occupants carried out everyday  activities. Iron objects are occasionally found in unexpected locations where  they appear to have been intentionally placed, and suggest less common, or ritual  activities.<br />
        <br />
  Openings in a building such as doors, windows, and  chimneys offer a route into private spaces and may be vulnerable to unwanted  intruders and uninvited guests. A variety of objects have been and are used by  people all over the world to mark the margins between inside and out and may be  seen as charms or expression of ritual life or belief. Many of these objects  are iron. Archaeologists at the Molly Berry Site in Prince George&rsquo;s County  found horseshoes beneath the windows of the cabin, for example. <br />

          <td><p>The Indian Rest Site in Calvert County yielded a number of iron artifacts in such locations. Indian Rest is a nineteenth-century log cabin site that was excavated over a number of years by volunteers working with archaeologists from Jefferson Patterson Park &amp; Museum and Calvert County Government. The dwelling there was occupied from at least the 1870s until 1934 by a succession of African American families. It has been vacant since then </p>
              <p>A small cache of objects was found near the surface  by the eastern doorpost of the main entrance to the house. It consisted of nails,  a button, peach pits, beads, mica, and a fragment of a tractor headlamp bearing  the trademark &lsquo;Ford&rsquo;. Together these bear similarities to <em>minkisi</em> and may represent the work of someone placing the items as  a blessing, a curse, or an attempt to make someone do something. The objects  were probably originally in a bag or bundle, the organic remains of which have  deteriorated in the soil. </p></td>

      </table>
      <p>About 18&rdquo; beneath the items in that cache, at the  base of the fieldstone foundation, we found a forged iron hoe blade partially under  one of the stones that make up the foundation of the cabin. The blade was  corroded but otherwise intact. Why would someone bury a serviceable tool like a  hoe blade in the builder&rsquo;s trench of the cabin in the 19th century?  The answer maybe that the iron itself was significant.<br />
        <br />
        Metalwork and specifically ironwork was valued in  areas of Africa from which many enslaved people were brought into the  Chesapeake. Iron was associated with Ogun, an <em>orisha</em> or <em>vodun, </em>whom  believers invoked to intervene in human affairs. The use of iron continued in  the west, perhaps with new influences. A contemporary practitioner of vodou in  New Orleans, upon hearing about the finds at Indian Rest and examining  illustrations of the unit in plan and in profile, offered an insight about the  two deposits: she said &ldquo;whoever put the<em> toby</em> [the cache] that was found near the top didn&rsquo;t know about the hoe  blade at the bottom or they wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered.&rdquo; That suggests that the  deposits were made by different people at different times. She added that she  didn&rsquo;t know of a special significance attached to the form of the hoe but noted  that to open her ceremonies, the officiant would strike a plowshare with an  iron spike. She said that act is called &ldquo;playing the hoe.&rdquo; </p>

        <tr>
          <td height="401"><p>The builders of the cabin may have placed the hoe  blade under the foundation at the time of construction to summon Ogun to  protect the dwelling. <br />
            <br />
              There are other reports of iron hoes with seeming  ritual use on archaeological sites; for example, a hoe blade was found between  the floors of a house in New Jersey, near a chimney.<br />
              <br />
              Near the chimney at Indian Rest was a collection of  items that included an iron spoked wheel probably from a child&rsquo;s toy and  threads indicating that it was buried with red cloth, which supports  interpreting it as a cache. Not only was it near the chimney&mdash;a common site for  concealed objects&mdash;but red fabric was often used by people of African descent to  create amulets, according to persons interviewed and cited in WPA interviews.<br />

      <p>The objects mentioned above are but a few of the  kinds that people have used and still employ as markers between spaces. Diverse  examples include a mezuzah on the doorframe of a Jewish household, and a  horseshoe above the doorway or fireplace in a Midwestern American home. Can you  think of others?</p>
