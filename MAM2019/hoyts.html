      <p>Over the centuries, all manners of objects and  substances, from the exotic to the mundane, have been pressed into service as  magical items. &nbsp;Liquids, ranging from the  first rainfall in May to blood and urine, are believed to have powers to convey  good luck, to heal, to bring harm or even bestow everlasting love. &nbsp;An inexpensive cologne developed after the  Civil War became one of those everyday items that crossed over into magical realms.</p>

          <td><p>In 1868, Eli Waite Hoyt created Hoyt&rsquo;s Cologne, which he sold out of his Lowell, Massachusetts apothecary shop.  After its rebranding as &ldquo;Hoyt&rsquo;s German Cologne&rdquo; in the early 1870s, this men&rsquo;s toiletry gained great popularity.  Its light and fresh fragrance was a mix of roses, violets, cloves and citrus.  The 1895 Montgomery Ward Company catalog offered the toiletry in three different sizes (Figure 1), but by the early 20th century, the company had begun offering small bottles that sold for five and ten cents. </p>
            <p>In the late 19th and early 20th  centuries, Hoyt&rsquo;s German Cologne became favored as a good luck product by some  segments of the African American community.</p></td>

      <p>  It was considered particularly useful for individuals engaged in card  playing and other games of chance. &nbsp;The  cologne could be added to bath water, used as a hand wash just before gambling,  or even employed to bless dice or cards. &nbsp;The five-volume study on Southern hoodoo,  conjuring, witchcraft and rootwork, published between 1936 and 1940 by Harry M.  Hyatt, contains numerous mentions of &ldquo;Hearts Cologne&rdquo; in reference to gambling  and money matters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hearts&rdquo; is widely  believed to be a mis-interpretation of the word &ldquo;Hoyts&rdquo;</p>
      <p>In Maryland, at least three Hoyt&rsquo;s bottles have been  found on early 20th-century African American home sites and their  presence could represent either magical thinking or the more mundane purpose of  scenting the body.</p>

      <p>Two  complete Hoyt&rsquo;s Cologne bottles were recovered from the Montgomery County  homestead of Malinda Jackson (18MO609). When the house caught fire around 1910,  the Jackson family had no time to remove personal possessions from the  residence, so archaeologists essentially excavated a time capsule from the day  of the fire. One cologne bottle was found in front of the hearth in the parlor,  while the other was found in the room&rsquo;s southwest corner.&nbsp; Neither bottle showed any evidence of burning  or heat damage (Figure 2, left). &nbsp;It is  possible that these two bottles had been stored in an upstairs bedroom and fell  into the parlor as the flames consumed the house or they could have been placed  in the two parlor locations to help attract luck and money.<br />
</p>
      <p>The other Hoyt&rsquo;s Cologne bottle was found in St.  Mary&rsquo;s County, at a small residential site believed to have been occupied into  the 1940s by African American tenant farmers (18ST747).&nbsp; The bottle is embossed &ldquo;Hoyt&rsquo;s Nickel  Cologne&rdquo;, which places its manufacture after the turn of the 20th  century, when the smaller sizes were introduced (Figure 2, right).</p>
      <p><br />
        Hoyt&rsquo;s Cologne can still be purchased today in &frac34; and  2-ounce sizes from online spiritual supply stores and from more standard  retailers like Walmart. &nbsp;It is touted as  bringing &ldquo;great good luck to gamblers&rdquo; and for use in dressing mojo bags. &nbsp;One store sells the ingredients for a mojo bag  for attracting love; one of the ingredients is Hoyt&rsquo;s Cologne, and the cologne  is dabbed on the completed mojo bag in a very specific pattern.</p>
