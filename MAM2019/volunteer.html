        <strong>Historic St. Mary&rsquo;s City: A Museum of History and Archaeology</strong><br />
        Historic St. Mary's City (HSMC) is the site of the fourth permanent<br />
        English settlement in North America, Maryland's first capital, and the birthplace<br />
        of religious toleration in America. The Department of Research &amp; Collections at<br />
        HSMC, with St. Mary's College of Maryland, offers a Field School in Historical<br />
        Archaeology from May 28 through August 3, 2019. While in the field, staff and<br />
        students offer tours of the excavations to visitors. During the Tidewater<br />
        Archaeology Weekend event (July 20 &ndash; 21), members of the public can sift for<br />
        artifacts with the archeology team and take special tours of the archeological<br />
        laboratory and other museum sites. Visitors are also encouraged to explore the<br />
        St. John&rsquo;s Site Museum, which provides insights into ways researchers use<br />
        historical and archeological evidence. Contact HSMC 240-895-4990, 800-SMC-<br />

        Field and Laboratory Volunteer Opportunities Statewide<br />
        One of the Archeological Society of Maryland&rsquo;s main goals is to involve<br />
        the public in field and lab events throughout the year and across the State. To<br />
        meet this goal, ASM hosts a Spring Symposium and an annual Fall meeting, and<br />
        co-hosts with the Maryland Historical Trust a Spring Workshop and a late spring<br />
        field/excavation session. ASM&rsquo;s local chapters also conduct meetings and<br />
        provide opportunities for members and the general public to participate in field<br />
        and laboratory activities. Visit our website at www.marylandarcheology.org to<br />
        learn about upcoming events, view the latest edition of our monthly newsletter<br />
        (ASM Ink), and link to our chapters&rsquo; websites.</p>
