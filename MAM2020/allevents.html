        </strong>Excavations: 2020 Field School in Historical Archaeology<br />
        Historic St. Mary&rsquo;s City (HSMC), in association with St. Mary&rsquo;s College of Maryland (SMCM), 
        announces its 2020 field school in historical archaeology. The 2020 field season will be focused 
        on sites in the Mill Field. Located northeast of the Town Center at the heart of the colonial 
        capital, the Mill Field takes its name from its proximity to the 17th-century mill that was critical to 
        the town&rsquo;s survival. As St. Mary&rsquo;s City developed in the latter half of the 17th century, the Mill 
        Field become home to a number of the city&rsquo;s residents. The road to the mill was one of the key 
        elements of the city&rsquo;s unique Baroque plan. This portion of the city has only been nominally 
        studied and is sure to yield significant information about the development of St. Mary&rsquo;s City.<br />
