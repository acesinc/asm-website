published numerous archeological articles and several monographs, and donated his collection to the Smithsonian Institution. A commercial artist by profession, he was nonetheless a

<strong>Timothy B. Riordan, HSMCC</strong></p>
<p style="color:black">Excavations began in the Chapel Field in 1983 and evidence of burials was immediately obvious. In the years since, HSMC has identified over 250 graveshafts and 
evidence suggests that there may be as many as 1000 people buried in this field. Starting with the spectacular discovery of the lead coffins in 1990, burial archaeology has been an 
important part of understanding the use and meaning of the Chapel site. Since 1990, 65 burials have been excavated and the remains of 75 individuals removed. Because of the unique 
circumstances of the Chapel Field site, it has been possible to divide the burials into three equal periods, spanning 1638-1730. Insights on coffin shape, use, and construction are 
outlined. The context of “shroud pins,” commonly found in 17th-century burials, is explored. The significance of changes in burial patterns through the 17th century is considered.</p>

<strong>Bruce Thompson, Maryland Historical Trust </strong></p>
<p style="color: black">In recent decades, archeologists have probed ever deeper into the extant archeological evidence for colonial life in middle to late 17th century Maryland. Geographically, the key focus of those efforts has 
been on sites along the western shores of the Chesapeake Bay (the Bennett’s Point site on the Wye River being the exception). Using primary documents, artifact analysis and Maryland Historical Trust’s “Comparative Archaeological 
Study of Colonial Chesapeake Culture” (developed by a consortium of researchers from a number of regional institutions and hosted by The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation), this paper offers a comparative look at a middle to late 
17th-century Dutch site called the Grieb Site (18KE83) located on the Chester River.</p>

<p style="color:black"><font color="#c94c4c"><strong>Into the Zekiah: The Untold History</strong></font><br>
<strong>Julia A. King, Scott M. Strickland, and Michael J. Sullivan</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Perhaps one of the most interesting yet understudied regions in Maryland's early colonial history is the Zekiah Swamp located In Charles County. The Zekiah -- an ecologically diverse freshwater bottomland 
swamp 20 miles in length -- was the setting for some of the most colorful events in the colony's history. The Zekiah was home to a fascinating mix of people. Here, Lord Baltimore built a summer house where he could be close to his 
dear friend, Major William Boarman. It was on Major Boarman's plantation that Irish Nell, Lord Baltimore's servant, married Saltwater Charles, a newly arrived African. When Baltimore tried to talk Nell out of the marriage -- after 
all, she risked enslaving herself and her children -- she told the proprietor to buzz off and was married that day. About five miles north upstream from Boarman's, Baltimore had relocated Maryland's Piscataway Indians into the Zekiah 
Fort, hoping to provide them some protection from aggressive northern tribes and land hungry colonist. John Pryor ran a store at the Zekiah's southern end, trading not just with the colonists but the Piscataway. The county seat was 
located here, too, with a relatively finely appointed courthouse, and a race track was maintained for several years on the courthouse property. And that dreadful turncoat, Josias Fendall, owned land in the Zekiah.</p>
<p style="color: black">For all of this interesting history, very little archaeology has been done in the Zekiah Swamp. Beginning in late 2007, a partnership involving St. Mary's College of Maryland, the College of Southern 
Maryland, and a consortium of interested businessmen in Charles County began a long-term project to map the Zekiah's patent history and identify important 17th-century sites. This presentation describes those sites that have been 
found, including the Court House, John Pryor's store, and Johnsontown, as well as the progress to date searching for Major Boarman's dwelling plantation, Lord Baltimore's summer house, and, most significantly, the Zekiah Fort.</p>

<strong>James G. Gibb, Port Tobacco Archaeological Project</strong></p>
<p style="color: black">Less than two years of archaeological survey and testing at the Colonial town site of Port Tobacco in Charles County has revealed the probable location of Potobac (mapped by Captain John Smith in 1608), a 
previously unknown Colonial period cemetery, several early to mid-18th century house sites, the County’s third generation jail (1859-1897), and several well-defined Archaic sites. This illustrated presentation will summarize the 
combined archival and archaeological research completed to date and discuss the annual field session which will occur at Port Tobacco from May 22 through June 1.</p>
