    				                      <p align="left" style="padding-right: 30px">After earning highest honors as an anthropology undergraduate at Tufts 
                                  University, Maureen went on to pursue a master&#8217;s degree in archeology at the University of Wisconsin in 
                                  Madison where she did paleodietary research on human skeletal material. It&#8217;s interesting how the 
                                  &#8220;circle of life&#8221; works on multiple levels; in Maureen&#8217;s case, human skeletal material 
                                  represented both an early interest and would come to dominate the last several years of her working life.</p><br>
				                          
                                  <p align="left"style="padding-right: 30px">Her first 12 years in Maryland were with the Maryland Geological 
                                  Survey&#8217;s Division of Archeology under Tyler Bastian, where she immediately took over the reins of the 
                                  Monocacy River Research Project, creating the statistical research design, conducting the field work, and writing 
                                  the report. That report, and the prehistoric predictive settlement model it contains, stands as a classic
                                  in Maryland archeology. In addition, she published two journal articles and presented two professional papers 
                                  on this work, reflecting a sense of responsibility to the profession that characterized her entire career.  Her 
                                  support of the Archeological Society also began during her time at MGS through her work with the Annual 
                                  Field Sessions in Maryland Archeology where she co-directed with Dennis Curry two Sessions at the 
                                  Chapel Point site, and three Sessions at the Rosenstock site. She also served as the MGS volunteer 
                                  coordinator. From this beginning, Maureen established her dedication to the members of the Society, 
                                  for whom she worked tirelessly over the balance of her career.</p><br>
				                          
                                  <p align="left"style="padding-right: 30px">While at MGS, Maureen applied her organizational skills to 
                                  the management of the archeological sites inventory. Recognizing the applicability of computer database 
                                  systems to this inventory, Maureen computerized the inventory in a time when personal computing was in 
                                  its infancy, and database software was limited and rapidly evolving. This work led to a growing interest 
                                  in Geographic Information Systems and ultimately to a Master&#8217;s degree in Computer Science from the 
                                  Johns Hopkins University. Following the move of the research branch of the archeology office from the 
                                  MGS to the Maryland Historical Trust in 1991, this new skill placed Maureen in a position to develop one 
                                  of the nation&#8217;s first GIS-based site inventories.</p><br>
                                  
				                          <p align="left" style="padding-right: 30px">At MHT Maureen built and then nourished the GIS-based 
                                  inventory, developed and elaborated the various sites computerized databases, and grew the GIS 
                                  program through the successful pursuit of numerous grants. Prior to this work site records were on 
                                  paper and USGS quad maps, all stuck in cabinets, and with no way to easily search them. The databases 
                                  Maureen developed are vital for planners and researchers, and represent a sea-change in the way 
                                  archeologists do their business. While masterfully coordinating this effort with her right hand, 
                                  Maureen (who is left-handed) was able to maintain her dedication to the archeological volunteer 
                                  community and solid archeological research by continuing her involvement in the Annual Field Session. 
                                  Her continued co-direction at the Rosenstock site with Dennis Curry led to a published report and 
                                  two professional presentations. When Maureen was tapped to assume the Chief Archeologist position 
                                  at MHT in 2004, she re-doubled her professional and personal commitment to archeology, while still 
                                  maintaining all of her GIS responsibilities. It is a particular characteristic of Maureen&#8217;s 
                                  that she was able to juggle both of these heavy duties with effortless ambidextrous ability. In 
                                  her role as Chief Archeologist, Maureen organized nine Annual Workshops, oversaw the site selection
                                  and assisted in the logistical planning and supervision for nine Annual Field Sessions, published 
                                  two articles, and co-chaired the Working Group on Native American Human Remains. This latter duty 
                                  required all of Maureen&#8217;s intellect and compassion, and both were in perfect form during all 
                                  of the four and a half years of near constant work, eighteen meetings, and eight ceremonies where 
                                  remains were returned to the earth. Maureen&#8217;s skill in negotiating the mine field of emotional 
                                  content this work presented was nothing short of heroic, and allowed her to arguably do more to 
                                  improve relations between the Maryland Indian communities and archeologists than the sum of all the 
                                  efforts that came before.</p><br>
                                  
				                          <p aliogn="left" style="padding-right: 30px">For these reasons, and many other small yet significant 
                                  accomplishments as an archeologist and friend to the archeologically-inclined citizens of Maryland, 
                                  on the cusp of her retirement Maureen has earned the thanks of the Archeological Society of Maryland, 
                                  and has assurably earned its highest honor: the Marye Award.</p><br>
