      <p>In early modern England, as well as in the  British colonies, the belief in a &ldquo;witch&rdquo; as inherently evil and a tool of the  Devil was widespread. The Christian church&rsquo;s focus on salvation from the evil  forces of &ldquo;devilry&rdquo; fostered this belief. The daily struggles of human life were  seen as a direct result of the great cosmic battle between God and the Devil,  with the witch as one of the Devil&rsquo;s primary weapons. Communities felt  compelled to identify the witches in their midst and to find ways to protect themselves  from their malevolent intentions. Outbreaks of witchcraft hysteria and  subsequent mass executions began to appear across Europe and America.  Individuals turned to ritual magic to counter witch&rsquo;s curses or to ward off  evil spirits from their homes. Evidence of these magical charms in the form of  &ldquo;witch bottles&rdquo; have been found on archaeological sites throughout England and  America, with five known examples in the state of Maryland&rsquo;s archaeological  collections</p>

        <tr>
          <td><p>While  there are variations, most witch bottles were made by filling a glass bottle or  ceramic jug with urine, human hair and/or nail clippings, animal bone, and  sharp objects, such as nails or pins. The bottle was then buried inverted by  the entrance to a home or under a hearth. When created as a counter-curse, the  placement of sharp objects in the victim&rsquo;s urine was believed to turn the curse  back on the witch, making the witch unable to urinate, and ultimately leading  to the witch&rsquo;s demise. Inverting the bottle when buried also symbolized the  reversing of the witch&rsquo;s magic. While it is impossible to know the true intent behind  the creation of any specific witch bottle, many may have simple been preemptive  protective charms rather than a counter-curse directed at an individual  witch.&nbsp; </p></td>

      <p>The  two examples of witch bottles from 17th-century sites in Maryland are  both represented by multiple bottle burials. The remains of four case bottles  were found in a small pit near a possible chimney or entranceway to an earthfast  house at the Patuxent Point site in Calvert County. Three corroded nail  fragments, a pig&rsquo;s pelvic bone, and the lower jaw of a small mammal were also  recovered. All four bottles were broken; however, it appeared that they all  went into the ground intact, indicating an intentional burial. At the Addison  Plantation site in Prince George&rsquo;s County, three wine bottles were found buried  together at the top of the passageway leading from the cellar of a structure  similar to the one at Patuxent Point. While no additional artifacts were  recovered, the burial location and the inverted position of the bottles support  the identification of these as a possible protective charm.</p>
      <p>An example of an 18th-century witch bottle  burial was found at the White Oak site in Dorchester County. A wine bottle neck,  horseshoe, bottle glass sherds, and bone fragments were recovered by a brick  hearth. Several straight and bent pins had been inserted into a solid stopper  in the bottle neck, both on the inside and outside of the bottle. The horseshoe  may have also been associated with the ritual burial, as iron in any form holds  its own protective powers</p>

          <td width="288"><div align="left">The  two examples of possible witch bottles from 19th-century contexts in  Maryland were not made from wine bottles but from redware ceramic jars. These  may represent an evolution of the traditional witch bottle into a good luck  &ldquo;bottle charm&rdquo;. One was a redware ceramic vessel found buried with a horseshoe  below a hearth in a house in Fells Point in Baltimore City. The location of the  jar and the horseshoe indicates that this ritual burial may have played a  similar role to witch bottles found on the colonial sites in Maryland. A  similar but slightly smaller ceramic jar was found buried in the  southeasternmost corner of the brick manor house cellar at the Addison  Plantation site. No other artifacts were recovered, so it is possible this  vessel was simply used for storage. However, its similarity to the vessel from  Fells Point is intriguing.</div></td>

      </table>      <p>These  witch bottles and bottle charms are clear evidence that folk magic, deeply  rooted in European traditions, was alive and well, not just in the early years  of the colonies, but well into the 19th century. While such efforts  may seem amusing to us in the 21st century, these magical objects  represent sincere efforts by individuals to protect themselves from what were  perceived as very real threats from the supernatural world.</p>
